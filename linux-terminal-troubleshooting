Ubuntu GNOME Terminal Troubleshooting (VirtualBox)

Overview

This repository documents a real troubleshooting scenario encountered after reinstalling Ubuntu Desktop in VirtualBox, where the GNOME Terminal failed to open, even though the operating system itself was working correctly.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate:

Linux troubleshooting methodology

Use of TTY for recovery

Understanding of user permissions and sudo

Diagnosing application-level issues

Real system administration practices


This is a learning-focused lab, not a perfect setup.


---

Environment

Host OS: Windows

Virtualization: VirtualBox

Guest OS: Ubuntu Desktop (22.04 LTS)

User account: sysadmin



---

Problem Summary

After reinstalling Ubuntu:

System booted normally

GUI login worked

GNOME Desktop loaded successfully

GNOME Terminal did not open


Observed behavior:

Clicking Terminal icon → loading spinner → disappears

Ctrl + Alt + T did nothing

Alt + F2 → gnome-terminal failed

Restarting the system did not resolve the issue



---

Initial Diagnosis

Key observations:

System was responsive

GUI was functional

Keyboard shortcuts worked

Only GNOME Terminal was failing


This indicated:

> The OS, kernel, and desktop session were healthy
The issue was isolated to gnome-terminal or user configuration




---

Troubleshooting Approach

Instead of reinstalling the OS again, a structured troubleshooting approach was used:

1. Bypass the GUI


2. Verify system health via TTY


3. Check user privileges


4. Reinstall affected packages


5. Validate system using an alternative terminal



This mirrors real server and cloud troubleshooting workflows.


---

Issues Encountered

1️⃣ Terminal Not Opening

GNOME Terminal failed silently without error messages.

2️⃣ No sudo Access

Running administrative commands resulted in:

sysadmin is not in the sudoers file

This confirmed the user was created without sudo privileges, which blocked normal package management.


---

Resolution Strategy

Used TTY for recovery access

Switched to root user for administrative tasks

Reinstalled GNOME Terminal components

Reset GNOME user configuration

Installed an alternative terminal (xterm) to validate system health



---

Final Outcome

Ubuntu OS is healthy

Networking works

Package manager works

GUI session works

GNOME Terminal issue is isolated and non-critical


xterm working confirmed:

Shell is functional

User environment is usable

No OS reinstall required



---

Key Learnings

GUI failure ≠ OS failure

TTY access is critical for Linux recovery

Always isolate the problem before reinstalling

Root access is essential for system troubleshooting

Alternative tools help validate assumptions



---

Real-World Relevance

Servers often run without GUI

TTY is equivalent to:

Physical console

Cloud serial console


This scenario closely resembles:

Cloud VM recovery

Sysadmin troubleshooting

Support engineer workflows




---

What Was Intentionally Avoided

No OS reinstall

No random permission changes

No unsafe config deletion

No blind fixes


This keeps the system clean, traceable, and auditable.


---

Screenshots

⚠️ Some screenshots were lost due to clipboard reset during reinstall.
This repository focuses on process and reasoning, not visuals.


---

Next Steps

Assign proper sudo privileges to user

Configure SSH access

Document networking configuration

Transition system toward server-style usage

Replicate setup on a cloud VM



---

🔽 Commands Used (Step-by-Step)

This section lists all commands executed, in the order they were used.


---

Switch to TTY

Ctrl + Alt + F3


---

Login as user

Username: sysadmin
Password: ********


---

Attempt sudo (failed)

sudo apt update

Error:

sysadmin is not in the sudoers file


---

Switch to root user

su -


---

Test GNOME Terminal

gnome-terminal

Result:

Terminal exited immediately



---

Reinstall GNOME Terminal packages

apt install --reinstall gnome-terminal gnome-terminal-data libvte-2.91-0 -y


---

Exit root

exit


---

Reset GNOME configuration

dconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/
dconf reset -f /org/gnome/


---

Install alternative terminal

sudo apt install xterm -y


---

Launch xterm from GUI

Alt + F2
xterm


---

Result

xterm opened successfully

Commands executed normally

System confirmed healthy
